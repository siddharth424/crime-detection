# Criminal Catcher

Criminal Catcher is a mobile application built with Flutter, which aims to simplify the process of filing a FIR/complaint. In the current situation, filing a FIR/complaint is a difficult task because one must go to a police station and wait until a cop takes the request and either recites or provides a written statement. It makes no difference how small or large the crime is.
